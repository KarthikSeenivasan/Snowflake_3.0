#DBT Project Readme for Snowflake_3.0

This readme file provides an overview and instructions for the DBT (Data Build Tool) project. DBT is a popular open-source tool used for transforming and modeling data in data warehouses. This project aims to streamline data transformations and facilitate collaboration among data engineers, analysts, and data scientists.

dbt_project.yml: The configuration file for the DBT project.
models: Directory containing the core models that define the data transformations.
base: Directory containing the base model, which serves as the foundation for other models.
transformations: Directory containing the transformation models that build on top of the base model.
macros: Directory containing reusable macros for SQL transformations.
analysis: Directory containing SQL queries used for analysis purposes.
data: Directory containing raw and processed data files.
test: Directory containing test files for models.
Getting Started
To get started with this DBT project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone <repository-url>
Install DBT by following the installation instructions from the official DBT documentation.
Configure your database connection details in the dbt_project.yml file.
Run the following command to install the required dependencies: dbt deps
Create the necessary database tables and structures by running: dbt seed
Transform and load the data by executing the DBT models: dbt run
Verify the results and perform analysis using the SQL queries in the analysis directory.
To run tests, execute: dbt test
